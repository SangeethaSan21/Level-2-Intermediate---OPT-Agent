This automation saves the bakery 15 minutes per day and $50 per month, while also ensuring timely replenishment of stock. By streamlining communication with suppliers, the bakery can improve its overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Current Workflow (BEFORE Automation)\n1. The bakery employee manually counts the inventory items.\n2. The employee writes down the count on a piece of paper.\n3. The employee updates the Excel file with the new count.\n4. The employee checks the Excel file for low stock levels.\n5. The employee manually emails each supplier for low stock levels.\n\u23f1\ufe0f Time: 30 minutes\n\ud83d\udcb0 Cost: $10 per day (labor cost)\n\ud83d\ude2b Pain Points: Manual data entry, manual emailing, and potential for human error.\n\n### \u2728 Automated Workflow (AFTER Automation)\n1. The Python script reads the Excel file and checks for low stock levels.\n2. The script sends automated emails to suppliers for low stock levels using Gmail.\n3. The script logs any errors or issues that occur during the process.\n\u23f1\ufe0f Time: 0 minutes (automated)\n\ud83d\udcb0 Cost: $0 per day (labor cost)\n\ud83c\udf89 Benefits: Reduced manual effort, increased response time, and improved accuracy.\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Technical Requirements\n**Software:**\n- Python 3.9+\n- `pandas` library for Excel file manipulation\n- `smtplib` library for sending emails\n- `gmail` library for Gmail integration\n\n**Data/Files:**\n- Excel file (`inventory.xlsx`) containing stock levels\n- Gmail account credentials for sending emails\n\n**Credentials/Access:**\n- Gmail API key for sending emails\n- Excel file access for reading and writing\n\n**System:**\n- Windows or macOS operating system\n- Scheduling tool (e.g. `schedule` library) for running the script daily\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Implementation Steps\n**Phase 1: Setup (15-30 minutes)**\n1.
